A groundbreaking open-source framework for achieving autonomous self-evolution and self-management in artificial intelligence (AI). NeuroCortex moves beyond traditional AutoML by introducing the **Self-Reinforcing Development Framework (SRDF)**, enabling AI systems to re-engineer their own architecture and learning processes without human intervention.

## 🧠 The SRDF Architecture

The core of NeuroCortex is a closed-loop system composed of three integrated units:

1.  **The Trawler**: Continuously analyzes data and performance to identify improvement areas and anomalies.  
2.  **The Generator**: Proposes novel architectural modifications, training strategies, or entirely new sub-models.  
3.  **The Arbiter**: Validates and integrates only the most effective innovations against rigorous performance benchmarks.  

Together, these units form a self-reinforcing cycle of continuous improvement, aiming to achieve **Evolutive AI**.

## 🚀 Vision

To transition from static, human-dependent AI models to **"Evolutive AI"**—systems capable of managing their own lifecycle, adapting in real-time to novel data, and driving sustainable innovation autonomously.

## 🔮 Applications

*   **Healthcare**: AI that redesigns itself to detect novel viruses within hours, not weeks.  
*   **Cybersecurity**: Autonomous systems that anticipate and counter emerging threats in real-time.  
*   **Engineering**: Accelerated discovery of new materials and products through autonomous simulation and design.  
*   **Industrial Automation**: Self-optimizing manufacturing processes and smart infrastructure without manual retuning.  

## 🤝 Contributing & Collaboration

We are actively seeking researchers, engineers, and visionaries to join this initiative. This is not just an incremental improvement; it's a foundational shift towards true AI autonomy.

# 🧠 NEUROCORTEX: SRDF Framework

**SRDF (Symbolic Relational Deep Framework)** is an experimental framework for **adaptive model refinement**.  
It combines symbolic reasoning with deep learning to continuously improve models through a loop of:

**Trawler → Generator → Arbiter → Model Update**
